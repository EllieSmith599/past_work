# Past Work
Here is some of the visualizations and work I have helped set up in the past.

## 2021 Senior Capstone
For my undergraduate capstone, I asked the question, when will the sport, Ultimate Frisbee be added to the Olympics. The reason I chose this is because I was part of Loyala's team during my four years there, and my senior year, I was the president. So, I thought it would be interesting to include the sport in my proposal. The proposal highlights what I learned during my four years majoring in Data Science and Statistics.

## Report
This is my final for my graduate data visualization class. It is 10 different charts regarding the health of American states as well as the proposed legislation. This displays my ability to create various charts in R as well as using R Shiny and R flexdashboard.

## IBM 

For my first project at Ibm, which lasted about a year, I was tasked with helping build a conversational dashboard to gain analytics regarding the health and performance of the clients multiple chatbots. Since the code is considered confidential, here is a link to the page which shows some of the features of the dashboard [Conversational Dashboard](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-assistant/analytics). Once set up, I performed my role as a Data Analysts and helped find areas of improvement along with the supporting data  in addition to creating charts to show visualizations to the client. As a way to give back, I created a new feature that was added to the dashboard which shows the amount of times people interrupted the chatbot or used a number key instead of responding. This data was used to create additional charts and to display when it happened during a converstaion.
